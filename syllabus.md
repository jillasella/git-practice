## What Are Fake Journals?

A **fake journal** is a blah blah blah.

They attract authors by spamming them with fawning emails.

### Characteristics of Fake Journals

- No ISBN
- Fake metrics
- Dishonest geographic information

## What Are Fake Conferences?

A **fake conference** is a blah blah blah blah.

They operate in much the same way as fake journals.
